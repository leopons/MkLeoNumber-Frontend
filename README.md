# MkLeoNumber-Frontend

This is the front-end of a web app. The app goal is to allow any Super Smash Bros Ultimate competitive player to calculate what I initially called his 'upset distance' to the best player in the world at this day, MkLeo. This is now better known as 'the MkLeo Number'.

Read more about that on [the backend repo](https://github.com/leopons/MkLeoNumber-Backend).
